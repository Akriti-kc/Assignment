<h1 id="1">Rose</h1>
<p>rose, (genus Rosa), genus of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the rose family (Rosaceae). Roses are native primarily to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon, and most have a delightful fragrance, which varies according to the variety and to climatic conditions.</p>
<h1 id="2">Babybreath</h1>
<p>Most times, we favor larger blooms than dainty flowers, but baby’s breath looks beautiful on its own or as a filler flower. Also, they can be grown with other drought-resistant plants as an annual or perennial flower. If you’re looking for delicate flowers to be used as a ground cover, some varieties of baby’s breath look excellent, especially in rock gardens.

    Baby’s breath might be dainty, but they make up for it in volume, adding a delicate look to bouquets, boutonnieres and centerpieces. In rustic weddings, they’re ideal for aisle, chair and cake decorations. These blooms are perfect for bohemian themed weddings too, as they look ethereal in flower crowns and hair accessories.</p>
